    Creating A Cohesive Color Palette
    (If you can create a website using only these five colors, you’ll get a much better result than if you were to go overboard with complementaries, split-complementaries, triads and the rest.)

        1. Base color: Brand color or color to be most used
        
        2. Accent color: Your accent color will be used in very small amounts on your website, usually as a call to action. So, it needs to stand out.

        3. Neutrals: white, dark gray, light gray(optional)
