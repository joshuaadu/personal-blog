1. Include the typefaces:
    Figure out which one aligns best with the brand that you're building for.

2. Define the scale or the different font sizes to use.
    Recommended: use a modular typograhic scale.
    Tools to use to generate one: Archetype

3. Recommended: use tokens for the various font sizes to use. 
    Avoid the use of hard coded values for font sizes on different elements.

4. Recommended: Create tokens for the font weights.

5. Don't for get the assessibility part for typography.
    Always use font size bigger than 16px
    Don't use upper case letters for the entire body text: It's super hard to read
    Use the appropriate line height for your text, because visually impaired people have a hard time reading text with 100% line height
    or with very large or very big line heights, like 200 or 250%

6. Colors should be accessible: Use the correct contrast there.
